# About the Data

We are committed to making Gray BRCA Atlas data available to the scientific community. Here you will find information describing the various Gray BRCA Pre-Cancer Atlas data types and how they are collected, analyzed, and shared.

## Data Types

The Gray BRCA Precancer Atlas is currently comprised of the following data types:

## Public Data Access

A key goal of the Gray BRCA Precancer Atlas is to provide access to primary data consistent with [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Data types with an available public repositories (i.e., transcriptomic data via GEO) are made available at the time of publication. Data without a clear subject repository are available in an AWS S3 bucket. For up-to-date instructions on how to download image data found on this website, please visit our access instructions on Zenodo ([DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10223574](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10223574)). Email tissue-atlas(at)hms.harvard.edu if you have questions or experience issues.
