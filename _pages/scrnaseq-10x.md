assay_instrument: "Here are some details about the assay, instruments on which the samples were run, etc."
data_access: |
  Access the data through:
  - GEO: FASTQ (Level 1) and BAM (Level 2)
  - AWS: H5 (Level 3)
  - or listed another way:
  - Level 1: FASTQ (GEO/TBD)
  - Level 2: BAM (GEO)
  - Level 3: H5 and RDS (AWS)
