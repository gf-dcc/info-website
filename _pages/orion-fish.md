# ORION-FISH

ORION-FISH is developed using the [ORION platform]({{ "/orion" | relative_url }}). Orion is a method for collecting one-shot and multi-cycle 18-plex immunofluorescence images. Following ORION staining and imaging, a morphology-preserving DNA-FISH assay was applied to the same FFPE section. In this way, ORION-FISH, which integrates high-plex tissue imaging with a morphology-preserving DNA-FISH protocol and single-cell registration/scoring, yielding measurements concordant with clinical FISH. ORION-FISH enables a biology-first approach to spatial genomics: providing a practical, scalable bridge between high-dimensional genotype-phenotype maps and human-interpretable, tissue-based validation. The framework is readily implementable in research laboratories while remaining naturally aligned with clinical pathology workflows. We are applying this method to map chromosomal changes and link aneuploid cells to the immune microenvironment and cancer progression.
